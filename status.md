Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have found the website that I would like to scrape from. I started scraping for certain information that I want to provide for the user. I was able to ask the user for input and allow them to pick the stock that they want to scrape. When they pick the ticker it will scrape the information through yahoo finance. I used an f string to allow them to pick the stock that they want and go to the website corresponding to the ticker.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not gotten all the information that I want for the project. I also wanted to create a stock projection using pandas that I haven't gotten to. Additionally I want to be able to grade the stock based on an algorithm that I come up with however I haven't came up with it yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Web scraping has been a bit difficult because I can't seem to be able to isolate some of the information that I want.
